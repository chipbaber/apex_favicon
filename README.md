Below you will find instruction on how to customize your favicon for an Oracle APEX application.

- These steps assume you have created a favicon set, typically this is done by a UI/UX artist. In our example you can reference images in the /fav folder for the example in this repo. In many cases you will have considerably more favicon sizes for various devices than in this example.
